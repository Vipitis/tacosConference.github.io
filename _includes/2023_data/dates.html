				<h2 class="section-heading">What is the TaCoS?</h2>
					<center>
					<p> The Tagung der Computerlinguistik-Studierenden (TaCoS) was first organized in 1992 and takes place once every year. It offers students of computational linguistics and adjacent fields a chance to exchange views during talks and workshops. The conference is hosted by teams of student volunteers at their university. Participants traditionally receive accommodation and breakfast in exchange for a small fee. At the center of the conference stand talks, workshops, and poster sessions; each given by students for students. Established academics from the host university are invited as keynote speakers as well. In addition, there is a social program for everyone to connect and network.
					<br>
					This year marks the 32. TaCoS and our team at Heinrich-Heine University in DÃ¼sseldorf is proud to host the event this summer.
