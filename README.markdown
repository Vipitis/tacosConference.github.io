# TaCos 2022 Website 
This is the website template for the 2022 `Tagung der Computerlinguistik Studierenden` in DÃ¼sseldorf. The template is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) event theme cloned from https://github.com/melvinchng/event-jekyll-theme. 

## Website Documentation

## How to clone the website
**1. Check whether you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/).**

In the command line, type:
```sh
git --version
``` 
You know you have git installed when you see something like `git version 2.25.1`. If you don't, follow steps 1 and 2 in [this tutorial](https://docs.slam.phil.hhu.de/#/github_tut). For windows users, substitute the step that uses `sudo apt install git` with a download from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

**2. Install the prerequisites for the website**
Follow the tutorial for your operating system [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) and check if you have NodeJS installed:
```sh
node --version
```
If not, install it with the corresponding installer for your operating system from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

Finally, download Jekyll sitemap and Jekyll SEO gems.
```sh
gem install jekyll-sitemap
gem install jekyll-seo-tag
```
Should you encounter the error below when trying to install `jekyll-sitemap` you have to install ruby dev with `sudo apt install ruby-dev` for Linux/ Ubuntu (or look that up for Windows and Mac). 

```sh
gem install jekyll-sitemap
this error may appear

ERROR:  Error installing jekyll-sitemap:
        ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.

    current directory: /var/lib/gems/3.0.0/gems/ffi-1.15.5/ext/ffi_c

mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
```

**3. Clone the website**
In the command line, clone the website with the command below. It will be as new folder in the same folder that you run the command in. 
```sh
git clone git@github.com:tacosConference/tacosConference.github.io.git
```

You are done! :tada:

## Reviewing/Approving Pull requests
Here are some suggested steps if you have been tagged or would like to review and approve a pull request.
You might want to check out the [GitHub guide](https://docs.slam.phil.hhu.de/#/github_tut) if you are unsure about using git from the commandline. 

1. Pull the changes to your local version of the website: On your commandline (or git bash on Windows), navigate into the website folder and type `git pull`. 
2. Now type `git status` to see which branch you are on. If you are already on the branch that the pull request was made from, perfect. If not, switch to the branch with `git checkout <branchname>`. 
3. Host the changes locally with `jekyll serve`, to see if anything does not work or looks weird. Pay particular attention to anything that was changed. Try clicking all of the links, looking at picture/text formatting, etc.  You can see what was changed if you go to the pull request and click on `commits` and then choose the individual commits. 
4. If everything looks good you can click on `review` and then approve. 
5. Feel free to also merge the branch into the main branch by clicking on `Merge pull request`.
