- question: This is the first time I'm going to a conference. What do I do?
  answer: While it is perfectly fine to go into student talks without knowledge of the topics whatsoever, if you would like to make the most of your experience, it's best you look at the talks lineup (TBA) and create yourself a timetable so you know when to be at what room to listen to topics that interest you the most. Part of the fun at conferences is being able to directly ask the speakers about their research, having casual discussions and connecting with people from other universities, so bring a pen and paper to note down what you want to remember!

- question: Will I have to hold a talk in order to attend?
  answer: No, you can register just to attend the event. If you were thinking of registering just to attend the event, please register to attend the event.

- question: I want to hold a talk, what length should it be?
  answer: You will have a timeslot of 30 minutes for your talk. Your talk itself should take about 20 miutes, the final 10 are for questions and discussions. The topic you choose is up to you, there are no strict criteria to it outside of having to be related to computational linguistics.
  
- question: Do I need to study Computational Linguistics to attend?
