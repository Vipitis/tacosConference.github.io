- question: This is the first time I'm going to a conference. What can I do to make the most of it?
  answer: While it is perfectly fine to go into student talks without knowledge of the topics whatsoever, if you would like to make the most of your experience, it's best you look at the talks lineup (TBA) and create yourself a timetable so you know when to be at what room to listen to topics that interest you the most! Taking notes is completely optional, but part of the fun at conferences is being able to directly ask the speakers about their research, having casual discussions and connecting with people from other universities!
