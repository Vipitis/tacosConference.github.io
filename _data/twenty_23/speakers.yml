  topic: Semantic Roles for Semantic Parsing - Lessons Learned and Future Directions
  description: In this talk I report on efforts to annotate a parallel Role and Reference Grammar treebank (RRGparbank) with semantic roles for verbs. I discuss the annotation scheme developed, the annotation process, and semantic parsing results. Finally, I highlight some problems with existing annotation schemes based on VerbNet, PropBank, FrameNet, and VerbAtlas, and sketch a new scheme that solves some of these problems.

  topic: Computational models in Parkinson's Disease research
  description: Speech can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to capture fine changes in speech patterns in normal populations and individuals diagnosed with neuromotor disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this talk, I will demonstrate how computational models that are linguistically-informed can quantify acoustic and syntactic variations in PD patients.

  topic: Dialogue evaluation via Offline Reinforcement Learning and Emotion Prediction
  description: Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to fulfill user goals, such as booking hotels or searching for restaurants, through natural language interactions. They are ideally evaluated through interaction with human users. However, this is unattainable to do at every iteration of the development phase due to time and financial constraints. Therefore, researchers resort to static evaluation on dialogue corpora. Although they are more practical and easily reproducible, they do not fully reflect real performance of dialogue systems. Can we devise an evaluation that keeps the best of both worlds? In this talk I explore the usage of offline reinforcement learning and emotion prediction for dialogue evaluation that is practical, reliable, and strongly correlated with human judgements.
