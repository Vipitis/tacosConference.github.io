  topic: Computational models in Parkinson's Disease research
  description: Speech can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to capture fine changes in speech patterns in normal populations and individuals diagnosed with neuromotor disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this talk, I will demonstrate how computational models that are linguistically-informed can quantify acoustic and syntactic variations in PD patients.
