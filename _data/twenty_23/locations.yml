The campus of the HHU stretches nearly 4km long, but the conference will take place inside of the newly refurbished building 23.21, which houses the linguistics department, the PC-pools, and the cafeteria of the humanities department. The lecture halls, rooms, and floors that are reserved for keynote- and student talks, locationer presentations etc. will be announced soon.
