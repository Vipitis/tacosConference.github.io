To evaluate how language models handle code generation we publish a benchmark suite for creative programming tasks. The first task serves as a proof of concept and evaluates models on their ability to generate the return statement of a function. Language models reached about 0.28 while code specific models reached 0.37 and fine tuned models managed 0.60 for said metric. The benchmark and associated dataset are available on Huggingface.

However, they also interact in a way that can be described as the combination of both languages within the same discourse. This phenomena is known as translanguaging, and it is a common linguistic practice all around the world (de la Luz Reyes, 2012). It can be said that it involves the creation of new ways of communicating. Nevertheless, translanguaging is also often perceived as not being skilled in neither of the two languages (Wei, 2021). This social conception may cause students to restrain themselves from translanguaging with certain audiences, and reserve it for more casual conversations with fellow bilingual international students. The purpose of this research is to examine the translanguaging practices on social networks of Hispanic international students in American universities, with a focus on how they translanguage and what social functions their translanguaging practices have. To answer these questions, this study examines the posts and messages of five participants through critical and multilingual discourse analysis. The results show that participants translanguage at the sentential and suprasentential level, and that the type of translanguaging and its frequency are closely linked to the audience and the social network used. In other words, participants translanguage more frequently and in more diverse ways when communicating with fellow Spanish-English bilingual international students, while expressing different identities. The present study suggests that translanguaging is more complex than the mixture of two languages and its presence is highly reliant on the audience.</details>"
